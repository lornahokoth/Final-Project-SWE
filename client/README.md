## Project Description
This web application is the perfect medium for users who are interested in saving and sharing a recommendation list of their favorite movies, tv shows and book selections. 

## Project Motivation
There are a myriad of books, movies and tv shows to explore and it would be nice to have an application that allows users to create as well as share their own personal favorite picks (hence the name) to other users registered on the site. 

## How to set up project on your own environment
1. After cloning the repository into your own local repository, make sure you have these installation requirements (if not already installed):
    1. `pip3 install python-dotenv`
    2. `pip3 install requests`
    3. `pip3 install flask`
    4. `pip3 install psycopg2-binary`
    5. `pip3 install Flask-SQLAlchemy==2.1`
    6. `npm install react-router-dom@6`
    7. `npm install react-icons`

## What problem(s) our app solves:
Instead of users having to cross-reference multiple sites such as Goodreads.com and Netflix.com to get a good recommendations on what book, etc. they want to explore next, this application gives users the ability to build their own list of favorites based on user ratings and to be able to share select recommended titles to other uses.

## Conflicts encountered:
It was a challenge integrating all of the APIs in a single application. It was also difficult creating a search feature based on each of the APIs. We created the react app first and integrated flasks, so we had to approach certain tasks differently and rely mainly on react.

## Valuable lessons learned:
Prior to this project assignment, not many of our group members were familiar/confident with writing code in REACT JS. Since we decided to do all our app pages in react, we encountered a few different struggles with the integration of react components. We were able to work together/as well as research solutions to work through these new barriers and will continue to improve on them in Sprint 2.
